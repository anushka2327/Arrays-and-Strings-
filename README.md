# Experiment 7
# Arrays and Strings
## Overview
This repository contains experiments designed to help understand arrays and strings in C++. The exercises focus on the fundamental operations, including traversal, manipulation, and basic algorithmic applications.  
## Content  
1. Arrays in C++
Concepts Covered:  

Memory allocation for arrays    
Operations like traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching    
Key Operations:    

Array traversal  
Reversing an array
Finding minimum and maximum values  
Calculating sum and average of elements 

2. Strings in C++  
Concepts Covered:  

String manipulation techniques  
Common operations such as concatenation, substring extraction, and comparison  
Key Operations:  

String reversal  
Checking for palindromes  
Concatenating strings  
Each experiment aims to deepen the understanding of these core data structures in C++ through practical coding examples and exercises.
